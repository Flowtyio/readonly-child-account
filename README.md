**NOTE: This contract is still under development, its address is likely to be redeployed to testnet once it is
finished**

**Please see [Flow's documentation about account
linking](https://developers.flow.com/concepts/hybrid-custody/guides/linking-accounts) for more information and
examples.**

This repo contains a primary contract for managing ChildAccounts to permit hybrid custody in scenarios where apps only
want to share a subset of resources on their accounts with various parents. In many cases, this will be a user's primary
wallet outside of the application a child account came from

Apps need assurances that their own resources are safe from malicious actors, so giving out full custody might not be
the form of hybrid custody that they want. In this model, the app still maintains control of their managed accounts, but
they can:

1. Share capabilities freely, with a few built-in controls over the types of capabilities that can be returned with some
   helper contracts (the `CapabilityFactory`, and `CapabilityFilter`)
1. Share additional capabilities (public or private) with a parent account via a `CapabilityDelegator` resource

### Hosted `CapabilityFactory` & `CapabilityFilter` Implementations

> :information_source: `CapabilityFactory.Manager` implementations and `CapabilityFilter.AllowAllFilter` have been
> deployed to the accounts below for generalized use cases to make account linking as easy as possible. These
> generalized implementations likely cover most use cases, but you'll want to weigh the decision to use them according
> to your risk tolerance and specific scenario.
