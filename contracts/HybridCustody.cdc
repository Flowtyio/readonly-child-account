/*
HybridCustody defines a framework for sharing accounts via account linking. In the contract,
you will find three main resources being used:
1. ChildAccount - A resource which maintains an AuthAccount Capability, and handles publishing
    and revoking access of that account via another resource called a ProxyAccount
2. ProxyAccount - A second resource which exists on the same accounta as the ChildAccount. The ProxyAccount
    resource is the capability which is shared to a parent account. Each proxy has its own set of rules
    designating what Capability types can be retrieved, and what underlying type the capability points to can be
    given.
3. Manager - A resource setup by the parent which manages all child accounts shared with it. The Manager resource
    also maintains a set of accounts that it "owns", meaning it has a capability to the full ChildAccount resource and
    would then also be able to manage the child account's links as it sees fit.

        A helper method to make it easier to manage what parents an account has configured.
        The steps to sharing this ChildAccount with a new parent are:

        1. Create a new CapabilityProxy for the ProxyAccount resource being created. We make a new one here because
           CapabilityProxy types are meant to be shared explicitly. Making one shared base-line of capabilities might
           introuce an unforseen behavior where an app accidentally shared something to all accounts when it only meant to go
           to one of them. It is better for parent accounts to have less access than they might have anticipated, than for a child
           to have given out access it did not intend to.
        2. Create a new Capability<&{BorrowableAccount}> which has its own unique path for the parent to share this child account with.
           We make new ones each time so that you can revoke access from one parent, without destroying them all. A new Link is made each time
           based on the address being shared to allow this fine-grained control, but it is all managed by the ChildAccount resource itself.
        3. A new @ProxyAccount resource is created and saved, using the CapabilityProxy made in step one, and our CapabilityFactory and CapabilityFilter
           Capabilities. Once saved, public and private links are configured for the ProxyAccount.
        4. Publish the newly made private link to the designated parent's inbox for them to claim on their @Manager resource.
